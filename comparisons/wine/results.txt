The final obtained values after grid-search on c and gamma are as follows:
For one-vs-one: C= 512.0  Gamma =  0.015625 with max Cross efficiency =  1.982659
For one-vs-all: C= 128.0  Gamma =  0.03125 with max Cross efficiency =  2.006045
For dense: C= 128.0  Gamma =  0.03125 with max Cross efficiency =  2.004058
For sparse: C= 512.0  Gamma =  0.015625 with max Cross efficiency =  1.979712
